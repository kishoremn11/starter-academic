Honesty | Integrity | Transparency, the three mottoes of my life. It has taken me all the way from India to the US. In my personal life, I explore Global Competitiveness on Cognitive Intelligence, Freedom of Culture on Emotional Intelligence, Presence of Conscious on Spiritual Intelligence, and Persona of Ethics on Moral Intelligence. 

I aspire to become a subject matter expert on Product Design in Additive Manufacturing (AM) applications. I believe frugal innovations are key to human-centric designs. I work towards developing a virtual feedback system in additive manufacturing which is necessary to validate and qualify AMed components. 

Currently, in working towards this goal, I have streamlined a one-way virtual methodology to visualize the entire Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process and Direct Energy Deposition (DED) process. It generates the precise surface morphology of each layer deposited in the multilayer deposition process. It uses this surface morphology along with its melt pool dynamics, it is also possible to visualize the Residual Stress and Thermal Distortions. In DED, this method is further linked to surface modification techniques based on ultrasonic technology to shift a tensile residual stress region to a compressive residual stress region during each layer deposition. This hybrid technology not only improves the wear characteristics but also increases the fatigue life of the AMed component.  

So far, it's been two long semesters (Spring 2020 and Fall 2020) as a Graduate Student and one long semester (Fall 2020) as a PhD student at the University of Texas at Dallas. It's been an inspirational journey to work in [Dr. Dong Qian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xDtUresAAAAJ&hl=en)'s and [Dr. Wei Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=BSNTJEAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)'s research team.
